Description:
    Provides functions to conduct robust inference in difference-in-differences and event study designs by implementing the methods developed in Rambachan & Roth (2023, RESTUD), "A More Credible Approach to Parallel Trends" [Previously titled "An Honest Approach...". Inference is conducted under a weaker version of the parallel trends assumption. Uniformly valid confidence sets are constructed based upon conditional confidence sets, fixed-length confidence sets and hybridized confidence sets.
