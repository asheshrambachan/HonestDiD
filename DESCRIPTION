Description:
    Provides functions to conduct robust inference in difference-in-differences and event study designs by implementing the methods developed in Rambachan & Roth (2021). Inference is conducted under a weaker version of the parallel trends assumption. Uniformly valid confidence sets are constructed based upon conditional confidence sets, fixed-length confidence sets and hybridized confidence sets. See Ashesh Rambachan & Jonathan Roth, "An Honest Approach to Parallel Trends", 2021 for details on the methods.
